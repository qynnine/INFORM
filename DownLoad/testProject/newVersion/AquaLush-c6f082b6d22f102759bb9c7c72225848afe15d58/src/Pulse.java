/**
 *   The Pulse class provide a reliable pulse at arbitrary intervals
 *   to its observers. The default interval is 1000 milliseconds.
 *
 *   To make the pulse as accurate as possible, a Pulse object grabs the
 *   current time when it starts running, then notifies its observers
 *   thereafter every interval milliseconds that pass, even if the
 *   notification does not occur every interval milliseconds exactly.
 *   Thus individual observer notifications that a time period has passed
 *   won't be very accurate, but notifications over some period of time
 *   will be--in other words, the pulse is accurate over long stretches.
 *   Given the vissitudes of Java thread management, this is about the
 *   best that can be expected.

 *   @version 01/02 modified 03/02 to add observer pattern
