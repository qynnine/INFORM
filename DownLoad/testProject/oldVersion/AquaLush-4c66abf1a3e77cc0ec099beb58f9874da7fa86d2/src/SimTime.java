/**
 *  The SimTime object keeps simulated time, tracking the day of the week and
 *  the time to the second. It can also speed up and slow down, and stop and 
 *  start, allowing control over the simulation.
 *
 *  SimTime is a singleton class, so there can only be one instance of it.
 *
 *  SimTime is also a subject in the Observer pattern, so many objects can
 *  register for time passage notification.  The SimTime object notifies 
 *  its observers every simulated second.
 *
 *  When the SimTime instance is created, it begins at the present time.
 *  It begins stopped.
 *
 *  SimTime speeds can be set from 1 to 1000. A clock speed of 1 is real time;
 *  other speeds are multiples of real time.
