/**
 *  The Clock object is the device used by the entire program (outside the
 *  simulation) to keep time.
 *
 *  Clock is a singleton class, so there can only be one instance of it.
 *
 *  Clock is also a subject in the Observer pattern, so many objects can
 *  register for time passage notification. The Clock object notifies 
 *  its observers every minute.
 *
 *  The Clock uses a ClockDevice to get the time. The ClockDevice must be
 *  registered with the Clock before it is instantiated or it will throw
 *  a NullPointerException.
 *

 *
 *  @invariant  hour is in range 0..23
 *              minute is in range 0..59
