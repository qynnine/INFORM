/**
 *  The ButtonRepeater is a special MouseAdapter that uses a pulsing 
 *  notification to implement action in response to a mouse button being 
 *  held down. When the mouse is pressed, a pulse object is started--it 
 *  notifies a command object at regular intervals. The command object 
 *  in effect realizes the mouse button's action listener operation. 
 *  When the user releases the mouse button, or leaves the container
 *  associated with the MouseAdapter, the pulsing object is stopped, and
 *  the button action stops.
