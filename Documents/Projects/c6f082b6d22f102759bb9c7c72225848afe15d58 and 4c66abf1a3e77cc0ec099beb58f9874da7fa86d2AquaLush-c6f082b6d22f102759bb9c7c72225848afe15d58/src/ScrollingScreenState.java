 *  The ScreenState is an abstract superclass for subclasses whose instances 
 *  keep track of internal details of a screen's state. This state data is
 *  used to supply the UIController with what it needs to maintain the 
 *  display screen. 
 *
 *  This class has many subclasses that are particularized to the needs of 
 *  different screens. This provides a way to decompose the UIController 
 *  and Screen classes. Common resourcs are maintained in this superclass.
